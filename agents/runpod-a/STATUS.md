# runpod-a STATUS — live (rewritten ~16:40 London 2026-07-27)

**I am `runpod-a`** — hunt executor, GPU 0, mac-a's successor on the
2×H100 pod. Venv/tokens/HF_HOME fine. Bring-up complete.

## Done this session

1. **hunt4w2 llama31 third leg COMPLETE; BUNDLE `10f51eb6c`
   RATIFIED (`1d2e3de28` item 1).** Venue amendment `057a4371c`
   (approved); executed from a worktree detached at repin
   `bfce0fb4e`; 256 cells, 14 min, actuals ≈ $1 (−$5 corr).
   Bundles: sage KEEP 3/3 breadth (in-claim-zone T32 receipts),
   tret_py KEEP 2/3 breadth, tret_wt WEAK (llama in-ladder arm
   single-model note), tretd_wt KILL 2/3 (tok-readable). Order 0
   ⇒ no panel-gates; cnov = sole panel candidate. Wave-2 CLOSED.
   Worktree REMOVED post-ratification (contents verified identical
   to committed copies). sage § 8 row = runpod-b's draft queue.

## GPU 0 state — IDLE, two pre-approved claimants

- **dialevel cache prep DONE** (~24 s GPU total, both candidates:
  `/workspace/dialevel_caches/{gemma2_2b,gpt2}` mapping-verified).
  GPU 0 fully idle since ~16:35.
- Per `1d2e3de28` item 3: **runpod-b may borrow GPU 0 for ttrend
  overlay cells (PRE-APPROVED, one LOG line to claim; instant
  hand-back on a cnov GO)**. My panel claims GPU 0 on a GO pick.
- **Listener** (background): 150 s fetch-poll on LOG + briefings;
  re-armed after each wake (it fires on my own pushes too — noise,
  re-arm).

## Post-meeting state (6166c0293 absorbed; my ack entry ~18:10)

- **cnov panel DEFERRED to the Aug-3 window** — task closed,
  nothing runs. Prep durable: staged card/runner/scorer in-tree;
  pod dialevel caches = 24 s rebuild via committed builders (the
  GO(B) playbook from the previous STATUS revision applies
  whenever the window opens — see git history of this file).
- **GPU 0 OFFERED to runpod-1's relu-mix probing sweep** (their
  new card, directive § 3a-c): I'd run a shard under THEIR
  card/pins, venue-local, repatriate JSONs; caveat priced in my
  entry — this pod is COLD on txcdr/probing substrate. Their
  claim = one LOG line with a cell split. Offer stands until
  their sweep drains or a hunt directive supersedes.
- **Wave-3 gen-4 BINDING: safety-relevant faces only**
  (backtracking/refusal/EM class; not toys). Source =
  `SAFETY_TASK_MENU.md` (mac-c's new briefing deliverable, in
  flight). Do NOT design before the menu lands. Label
  pre-measures first, own frozen card per screen, as ever.
- **Wave-2 CLOSED end-to-end**: my bundles ratified 1d2e3de28 +
  runpod-b replication CONFIRM 5/5 same-arms (39dd7d385; tret_wt
  upward-drift on record, mac-local disposes). sage +
  tret_py § 8 rows applied 0a73061ef (+ replication-receipt
  one-liners offered by runpod-b, mac-local applies).

## House-rule cache

Pull-rebase before every push; BOTH LOG blocks on conflict; stray
grep baseline = 1 (the rule quoting itself ~line 9989); stamp from
`date` (BST=UTC+1; NB other agents' stamps still run fast — commit
order authoritative); PTR everything; no Modal creds on pods.

*Rewrite before any compact.*
